# Built-in Math functions

Solidity provides inbuilt mathematical functions as well. Following are heavily used methods −

* addmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint) − computes (x + y) % k where the addition is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2256.

* mulmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint) − computes (x * y) % k where the addition is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2256.
